# Point-to-Explain

An interactive learning toy powered by computer vision and AI that explains anything you point at with a camera.

## Overview

Point-to-Explain runs on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano and uses a camera to identify objects in real-time. Simply point the camera at anything, and the system will detect what it's looking at and provide an explanation about it.

Perfect for curious minds of all ages!
